**A reference for light animations using Neopixels. During my classes I usually cover some basics of Neopixels but these examples, based on wave generation and noise function are advanced and not required to pass my course. To understand the code, student must understand how sine wave is made and be proficient in programming.**

### Notes:
- *I'm using FastLED library (https://fastled.io/). The library includes 16 bit operations, wave and noise generation, HSV colors and is more efficient than Adafruit Neopixel Library. It's easy to use.*
- *Some examples can be tested on small 8 LED strip. However, most of them require at least 1 meter strip to see the effects. Some of them looks better on denser strip, depending on distance from which you are watching the animation.*
- *The inspiration were my observations of light effects during large-scale indoor musical events or live streams like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwCX_ywSqFc*
- *Examples can work on 16 MHz Arduino UNO but depending on amount of LED you might need something faster.*
- *I tried to mix some of my animations but mixing more than two becomes difficult and probably you should create one single effect from scratch. Also it's not good when too many things happens at once.*
